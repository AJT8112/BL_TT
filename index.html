    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Following difficulties with accessing and processing the files required for the full tech test, please see below a demonstration of code that will allow for the requested functions in the MVC section of the technical test. </p>
    <p>At this current moment in time I do not have expereince with C# or the .NET framework, I have self-taught (and attended courses on) HTML, CSS and JavaScript, however I am very excited to develop my understanding and implement the use of the .NET framework and Cloud technologies in my future career and invite the opportunity to utilise my passion to learn and develop.</p>

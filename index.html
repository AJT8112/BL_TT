        <h1>Hello and welcome to my alternative technical test (based on MVC tech test set)</h1>
        <p class="introPara">Firstly I would like to say thank you for allowing me to demonstrate my current abilities despite them not being in line with the original technical test provided. Whilst I do not currently have the technical understanding of the files in the dropbox, the C# language and .NET framework for this test, I am keen to utilise my passion for learning and development to quickly learn these skills with BLS.</p>
        <p class="introPara">In the meantime, please see below a demonstration of code that will allow for the requested outputs in the MVC section of the technical test. I completed this using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which I have both self-taught and attended courses for. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to pick your brain regarding ways I could improve this code, whilst also going over the question outlined in the JS Pseudocode lines 1 - 3.</p>
        <p class="introPara">I am very excited to use my desire for continuous improvement, to develop my understanding and allow me to implement the use of the .NET framework and Cloud technologies in my future career to best benefit both personal development and the BLS company (acronym used for anonymity).</p>
